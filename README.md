Frustrated with your commute? Transit Bandage is the solution!

Transit Bandage implements a new approach to getting service disruption information to riders. Gone are the days when you can't understand the train announcements that there will be a reroute - because now, you can check it on your phone in an instant! Know immediately if your train is delayed, and know immediately if there are other service disruptions.
